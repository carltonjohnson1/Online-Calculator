This was calculator I built for fun. The original idea was based on Tutorial by as my final project in a 10 week course I completed on becoming a Front-end Developer. The course was run by [GreatStack](https://youtu.be/cGgLHJGyS34?si=k4Cg4fOLGgJTg2Qo).

However, after made many modifications in CSS to tweak the look to my liking and also in JavaScript to improve the efficiency and functionality of the JavaScript code.
